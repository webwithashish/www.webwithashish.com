              a partner or the best news source, we have a multitude of options available to us.
              So why isn’t it pure bliss to be alive? Why are so many of us stressed out and unfulfilled?
              After all, we should have everything we want! <br> Well, it’s because we’re trying to do it all.

              As this book summary show, we need to find out what is important to us,

                  He embarks on a journey to follow his dream after meeting an old king who offers him magic

               <p> No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day.
                 James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies
                 that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors
                 that lead to remarkable results.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem
                 isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because
                 you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to
                 the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system
                 that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into
                 simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most
                 proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide
                 for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.

               <p> Rework (2010) is a how-to book for entrepreneurs who want to start an internet business.
                 It provides insights and strategies that can be used by people who want to start an internet
                 business, even if they don’t have prior experience. The argument of the book is that work
                 needs to be reworked because small companies can outmaneuver bigger enterprises by disposing
                 of outdated traditions and focusing on independence, flexibility, and economic prudence.
                 Advances in technology have made it possible to start a business without having to spend much money.
                 One can create a company and attract customers entirely online, even if they work from home.
                 What’s required for starting a successful business is believing in the product or service
                 being sold and working hard at making the company profitable over time.When a company finds a
                 way to solve one of its problems, it will have customers who would benefit from the same solution.
                 The business owner has to resist calls for unnecessary frills and changes that will detract from
                 overall quality and shrink his or her customer base. If the company places too much emphasis on
                 what others think, they might chase after fads instead of improving their performance.

               <p> For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical
                 abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness,
                 and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future
                 into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in
                 history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air
                 Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine
                 to name him "The Fittest (Real) Man in America."<br>
                 In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into
                 only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path
                 that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.

                 the love of your life. This book is full of examples from Joseph Murray’s life. Each example
                 showcases the fantastic potential for the subconscious mind to change people’s lives for the
                 better. Years of research studying the world’s major religions convinced Joseph Murphy that
                 some Great Power lay behind all spiritual life and that this power is within each of us.
