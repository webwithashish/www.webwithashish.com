              and also an Electronics and Tele-communication Engineer.
                I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.</p>

            <p class="article-para"> I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use,
               beautiful, accessible to all, and frustration-free. Regardless of your specific
                business requirements, in solving these challenges, you have a great chance of finding

            <p class="article-para"> My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design.
               Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology,
                and the layer that users interacts with, I believe having experience in both design
                 and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.</p>

            <p class="article-para">I take great pride in not only being able to complete work to the high
               standard you expect but also go the extra mile wherever possible.
               I enjoy getting to know a business, its goals,
               and how I can best apply myself to make sure your website succeeds.
               For established clients, I particularly like analysing their metrics and making
               data-based decisions and recommendations, leading to better rates of success.</p>
            <p class="article-para">I can quickly and efficiently join your team using continuous-integration

            <p class="article-para">Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved
               by breaking down a web page into its smallest pieces, often called components,
                and building them in a way that exists outside the context of the design they first appear in.
                 This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a website as it grows and
                  makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test. Wherever possible,
                   I find it valuable to create a style guide (using Storybook for example) that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a projectâ€™s language and produce a more consistent user experience. Re-usable components make for a website that can quickly grow as does your business.</p>
            <p class="article-para">I am also experienced in building systems that implement business
               logic and interact with server-side technology via APIs and tools such as React,
                as well as testing code using tools such as Jasmine.</p>
            <p class="article-para">I have a special interest in use of animation on the web.

            <p class="article-para">I believe it is important to understand both design and development
                   to achieve a successful user-facing product. By involving a front-end developer at the
                    design & prototyping phase, technical challenges can be solved early, producing a more
                     cohesive product in the most time efficient manner.</p>

            <p class="article-para">I am also a keen advocate of producing prototypes before fully coding.
                   These prototypes are a hybrid of design and interaction that enable a team to experience
                    how a user interface will feel before it is coded. This gives an opportunity for all involved
                     to provide feedback at an early stage and be a part of the iteration process.</p>
